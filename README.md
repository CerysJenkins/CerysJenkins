### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a data scientist working at Pharmatelligence (Cardiff, UK). We provide independent real-world evidence for healthcare services and the pharmaceutical industry.

I'm an R convert, and really interested in improving my machine learning, Markdown and Shiny skills. 

ðŸŽ“ I completed my PhD in 2019 at Swansea University. My main research focus was combining spectroscopy with machine learning to create a new blood test to diagnose cancer.
